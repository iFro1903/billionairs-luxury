    "title": "FAQ",
    "q1": "What is BILLIONAIRS?",
    "a1": "A gateway to experiences that exist beyond public reach. Not a marketplace. Not a service. A threshold into moments and access that cannot be replicated, advertised, or explained to those who haven't crossed it.<br><br>Think of it as the final collection—not of objects, but of perspective. Of transformation. Of access to realms where currency holds no meaning because what's offered cannot be purchased by any other means.<br><br>What lies beyond is yours to discover—but only if you're ready.",
    "q2": "Why the investment?",
    "a2": "True exclusivity demands commitment. What you access here isn't sold—it's granted. The threshold exists to ensure only those who understand value beyond price ever cross it.<br><br>Collectors of rare experiences know: the barrier itself is part of the curation. It's not designed to extract—it's designed to protect. To preserve the integrity of what lies beyond from those who measure worth in conventional terms.<br><br>If the commitment feels steep, you're exactly where you should be: questioning. That hesitation is the filter. A threshold that reshapes your perception of what access truly means.",
    "q3": "Who is this for?",
    "a3": "Those who have transcended conventional success. Individuals for whom money is no longer a question, but meaning is. People who've acquired everything publicly available and now seek what isn't.<br><br>Seekers of what exists between thought and reality. Those who understand that the rarest experiences don't appear in catalogs, aren't reviewed online, and leave no trace except in the transformation of those who encounter them.<br><br>If you're still measuring your worth by your portfolio, this isn't your moment yet.",
    "q4": "Security & Privacy",
    "a4": "Zero-knowledge architecture. Swiss banking-grade encryption protocols. Your identity, your transaction, your access—protected to the maximum extent technically possible.<br><br>Minimal records. Minimal trail. We exist in the spaces between systems, where discretion isn't a feature—it's the foundation.",
    "q5": "What you may gain",
    "a5": "Not a product. Not a service. Not a membership. Access to an exclusive digital experience crafted for those who exist beyond conventional boundaries.<br><br>What that becomes in your hands is entirely yours to shape. Just the experience itself. A perspective shift that cannot be purchased elsewhere. No records beyond those required by law. No sharing. No proof it ever existed—except in what it may unlock within you.<br><br>The experience is the transformation. Everything else is just context.",
    "q6": "How long does access take?",
    "a6": "Your access begins upon commitment. Full experience typically delivered within 2-3 days.<br><br>The interval isn't delay—it's preparation. By design. Some things cannot be rushed without diminishing their essence. The wait is part of the curation, ensuring what you receive has been calibrated to the exact moment your readiness is confirmed.<br><br>True exclusivity operates on its own timeline.",
    "q7": "Can I see examples or testimonials?",
    "a7": "No. If we displayed what participants have experienced, it would defeat the very essence of what we offer. Discretion isn't a policy—it's the product.<br><br>Those who've crossed this threshold understand why silence protects value. The moment exclusivity is proven publicly, it ceases to be exclusive. That's the paradox: the most valuable experiences are the ones that leave no evidence except in the eyes of those who lived them.<br><br>You're not buying proof. You're buying the absence of it.",
    "q8": "What if I change my mind?",
    "a8": "Commitment is designed to be binding. Not as punishment, but as protection—for you, and for the integrity of what you're accessing. The finality ensures only those truly ready ever cross.<br><br>However: In certain jurisdictions, legal withdrawal rights may apply—please consult applicable consumer protection laws in your region before committing.<br><br>Hesitation is your last exit. Use it wisely.",
    "q9": "Availability",
    "a9": "Because true exclusivity cannot scale. What we offer requires discretion, curation, and absolute focus on each individual who enters.<br><br>This operates on principles beyond supply and demand. When the parameters are met, access closes. Not artificially—inevitably. Scarcity isn't manufactured here. It's structural.",
    "q10": "How do I know this is real?",
    "a10": "You don't. That's the point. Trust isn't built through testimonials, guarantees, or proof. It's earned through the gravity of the decision itself.<br><br>Many valuable experiences in history operated this way: private experiences that demanded faith before evidence. The ones who hesitated read about it later. The ones who moved—they lived it.<br><br>If you need validation, you're not ready. If you feel the pull despite the uncertainty—that's when you know."
